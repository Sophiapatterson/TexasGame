Justin: My role was to implement all of the classes in the "screens" package, which included classes such as "ChangeScreen", "EndScreen", etc. These classes were in charge of creating the javafx scenes that would make up the game. For instance, these classes created the start screen from which the user could choose to go to the tutorial chooser or the game chooser, or the end screen that would be displayed after losing in any of the games. I was also in charge of implementing the tutorials for these games, which I did by using the "GameWorld" classes for each game, as well as the "Tutorial" class in the "game" package inside of the "engine" package.

##Design Goals

The main design goals were to make it easy to implement a new game apart from the three that we had already implemented. In terms of how different that new game could be, we made it so a new game could differ from the three already-created games with respect to how it looked (the player and enemy sprites, background, etc), what the rules of the game were, how the player interacted with the different enemies, as well as what the controls were (be it a single jump like our Dinosaur game or a constant jump like in our Jetpack and Flappy games).
