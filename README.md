Names: Sophia Patterson, Luke Evans, Justin Wu, Jeffrey Luo


### Timeline

Start Date: 2 April 2020

Finish Date: 24 April 2020

Hours Spent: approximately 35 hours per person

### Primary Roles

Game Configuration - Luke  
User Interface - Justin  
Game Engine - Jeffrey  
View - Sophia

### Resources Used

Sprites were found online and edited as needed.
Online resources like the JDK documentation and Stackoverflow were referenced during development
The imitations of Flappy Bird, Jetpack Joyride, and the Chrome Dinosaur game are well-intentioned
and out of respect for the original versions.

### Running the Program

Main class: Main

Data files needed: data folder and its sub-folders

Features implemented: 
- Dark mode
- High scores
- Tutorials for the three different games
- Credits mini-game

### Notes/Assumptions

Assumptions or Simplifications: To run the GenericGameWorld, the chosen properties file must contain every key

Interesting data files: As we are able to "draw" out our levels, one CSV file for 
Jetpack Joyride spells out "Hi" to the player. Other data files like "No_Length_Level",
"Empty_Level", and "Empty_Elements" are intended to showcase the program's abilities of
handling formatting errors. 

Known Bugs:
